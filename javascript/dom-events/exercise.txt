Use JavaScript to append input items to the end of the shopping list.

Make the input box clear out the text after adding it to the list.

If input value is empty don't add anything to the list.

Make it so both pressing enter or clicking the button adds the new item.

If you click on the list item, it toggles the .done class on and off.

Add buttons next to each list item to delete the item when clicked on its corresponding delete button.

BONUS: When adding a new list item, it automatically adds the delete button next to it 
(hint: be sure to check if new items are clickable too!)
